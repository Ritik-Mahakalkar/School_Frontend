          <p>I am really honoured and feel very privileged to function as the Principal of  School , Al Ain. Let me take this opportunity to thank the Management, Bhavans group of institutions -Middle East for giving me the opportunity to serve the community here in Al Ain.

           We, at School, ensure high quality education which motivates and empowers our students to be lifelong learners and the productive members of the society. At Bhavan’s, education is not just the amount of information that is put into a child’s brain. Our education system is the one that cater the individual needs of our students.
           <br/>
           We want all our students to achieve their full potential. Our task is to make it possible and our mission is to provide a platform for the same.

            Success for all students is ensured at our school by the delivery of an enriching, child centred, balanced and structured curriculum and a whole school focus on student welfare that focuses on the positive recognition of student achievements. Teachers work to provide students with differentiated support that address each student’s specific needs both academically and socially.Teachers at BPWS are highly qualified and experienced educators who are committed to supporting each student’s learning experience through quality instruction and guidance that addresses the needs of the individual child.
