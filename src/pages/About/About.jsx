      <h3>HISTORY</h3><br/>
      <p>The school lauched in 2024  by someone who makes this website which can seen by you </p><br/>
      <h3> MISSION</h3><br/>
      <p>The New School prepares students to understand, contribute to, and succeed in a rapidly changing society, thus making the world a better and more just place. We will ensure that our students develop both the skills that a sound education provides and the competencies essential for success and leadership in the emerging creative economy. We will also lead in generating practical and theoretical knowledge that enables people to better understand our world and improve conditions for local and global communities.</p><br/>
      <h3>VISION</h3><br/>
      <p>We are and will be a university where design and social research drive approaches to studying issues of our time, such as democracy, urbanization, technological change, economic empowerment, sustainability, migration, and globalization. We will be the preeminent intellectual and creative center for effective engagement in a world that increasingly demands better-designed objects, communication, systems, and organizations to meet social needs.</p>
      <p>Our vision aligns with shifts in the global economy, society, and environment, which animates our mission and our values:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creativity, innovation, and a desire to challenge the status quo will affect what and how we teach and the intellectual ambitions of the university itself.</li>
        <li>Social engagement should orient students' academic experiences to help them become critically engaged citizens, dedicated to solving problems and contributing to the public good.</li>
        <li>The New School must embrace these principles and innovate to address shifts in the global economy, society, and environment that require individuals to grapple with complex problems, pursue more fluid and flexible career pathways, and collaboratively create change.</li>
      </ul><br/>
      <h3>VALUES</h3><br/>
      <p>We at school always try to instil values like honesty, philanthropy, unity, sharing, and tolerance through various activities conducted in School. Values have always remained an integrated part of our curriculum, as our children start their day with morning assemblies which include prayer followed by thought for the day. Young absorbent minds are the best recipients of these values as they are so pure, and values inculcated in them at this early age would help them shape up as ‘future-ready’ global citizens. Regular value education classes are a part of the curriculum where children learn the correct values by listening or enacting stories and interacting with their teachers, who help them understand values.
         Our constant guidance profoundly shapes these young students’ minds during every stage of the learning process.</p><br/>
