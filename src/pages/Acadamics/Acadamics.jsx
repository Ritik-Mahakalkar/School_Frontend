       <h3>Pre-KG</h3><br/>
       <p>The Pre-KG at BPWS follows the EYFS curriculum. It has been personalized to reflect the holistic nature of children’s learning. The program focuses on the importance of learning through play and a commitment to structured, purposeful inquiry, as it underpins all development and learning for young children.

          There is an emphasis on ‘hands-on’ learning, engaging in physical and mental activities, and taking a holistic approach that addresses each developmental domain: creative, emotional, intellectual, physical, and social.<br/>

          Our inquiry-based approach is further guided by the EYFS outcomes and early learning goals, which are used as benchmarks for child development. The four themes of the EYFS underpin all the guidance. These are:
          <br/>
          <b>A unique child:</b> Every child is unique and is constantly learning, and can be resilient, capable, confident, and self-assured.<br/>
          <b>Positive relationships:</b> Children learn to be strong and independent through positive relationships.<br/>
          <b>Enabling environments:</b> Children learn and develop well in enabling environments, in which their experiences respond to their individual needs, and there is a strong partnership between practitioners and parents and carers.<br/>
          <b>Learning and development:</b> Children develop and learn in different ways. Teachers guide children by ensuring challenging, playful opportunities across the prime and specific areas of learning and development.<br/>

          </p><br/>
          <h3>KINDERGARTEN</h3><br/>
          <p>Acquiring good quality early years education is an undeniable necessity of every young child. The pre-primary stage of a child’s life is not only the most vulnerable but also the most significant for determining potential for lifelong learning and development. These are the years in which the child’s brain is developing at its fastest pace – social and personal habits are forming, and the foundation is being laid for life. Therefore, there is a need of developmentally appropriate curriculum during this stage to ensure strong foundation.

             School realizes these facts and has developed a strong play-based curriculum that caters to the all-round development of our tiny tots.  Our KG curriculum will enable the children to be better prepared to meet the immediate challenges and even the longer-term challenges of lifelong learning. A qualitatively rich environment is ensured to optimize child’s overall development. Our KG programme is wholly and comprehensively child-oriented, play based, fun-filled and activity based which is different from tradition-based approach. This kind of environment helps children to develop confidence and many skills including social skills. Focus is also given to imaginative play which provides an opportunity for kids to practice and develop their language and social skills simply by being with and talking to other children. It boosts development of problem solving and self-regulation skills. For the children of KG -1 (LKG), we have designed and properly developed a ‘readiness programme’ to prepare tiny tots for formal reading, writing and mathematics, i.e., programme for reading readiness, writing readiness and number readiness.</p>

          <h3>PRIMARY SECTION (GRADE 1 TO 5)</h3><br/>
          <p>At BPWS, Curriculum in primary classes is based on CBSE guidelines. Primary education is not just about preparing children for secondary school.  While insisting on the importance of literacy and numeracy, the school also lays foundations in other areas – in spoken language, science, arts, and humanities, in physical, emotional and moral development and live experience. A greater focus is given on evidence based teaching enabling teachers to help every child achieve the highest possible standard in all aspects of their education. School gives much focus on experiential learning. Concepts taught in different subjects are directly linked to everyday life of the child. The primary curriculum also promotes cross curricular approach, critical thinking, and problem solving skills and provide opportunities to explore and discover</p><br/>

          <h3>MIDDLE SCHOOL SECTION (GRADE 6 T0 8)</h3><br/>

              <h3>SECONDARY SECTION (GRADE 9 AND 10 )</h3><br/>
              <p>The curriculum provided by the CBSE in Secondary section is based on National Curriculum Framework-2005 and seeks to provide opportunities for students to achieve excellence in learning. It provides ample scope for physical, intellectual, and social development of students.  The curriculum upholds Constitutional values such as Socialism, Secularism, Democracy, Republican Character, Justice, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, Dignity of Individual and the Unity and integrity of the Nation by encouraging values-based learning activities.

                 It also nurtures Life-Skills by prescribing curricular and co-curricular activities to help improve self-esteem, empathy towards others and different cultures.  The curriculum in secondary classes equally emphasize Co-scholastic areas of Art Education and Health and Physical Education.

                 Secondary Curriculum provides students a broad and balanced understanding of subjects including languages, Mathematics, Science and Social Science to enable students to communicate effectively, analyze information, take informed decisions, construct their worldview in alignment with constitutional values and move ahead in the direction of becoming productive citizens.

                 The recent focus of CBSE is on the development of 21st century skills in settings where each student feels independent, safe, and comfortable with their learning. The curriculum is aligned in a way so that children feel more connected to it and employ their learning in real life contexts. To achieve this aim, it is extremely important that children acquire adequate knowledge and skills in other core areas like Health and Physical Education, Life Skills, Values Education, Art Education, Work Education, and other Co-Scholastic areas.

                In operational sense, the secondary curriculum is learner-centered with school being a place where students would be acquiring various skills; building self -concept, sense of enterprise, aesthetic sensibilities and sportsmanship. Therefore, for the purpose of fostering core competencies in learners, the curriculum encompasses major learning areas, from scholastic and co scholastic point of view.</p>
