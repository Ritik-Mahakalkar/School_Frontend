                <h3>Student Life</h3><br/>
                <p>Student life is meant to help us learn discipline and study. Despite that, life is quite enjoyable. The struggle is low in student life. One must get up early in the morning to get ready for school or college.

Similarly, rushing to the bus stop is very exciting during student life. The mothers constantly remind us to hurry up and not be late. It is no less than a mantra for all mothers.

In addition, there are other exciting moments in student life. We sometimes forget to complete our homework and then pretend to find the notebook when the teacher asks for it.

With the examination time around the corner, the fun stops for a while but not long. One of the most exciting things about student life is getting to go on picnics and trips with your friends.

You get to enjoy yourself and have a  lot of fun. Even waiting for the exam result with friends becomes fun. The essence of student life lies in the little things like getting curious about your friend’s marks, getting jealous if they score more, and so on.

The excitement for games period or learning about a new teacher. While student life teaches us discipline, it also gives us a lot of fun. It is a memorable time in everyone’s life.</p><br/>

                <h3>Extra Caricular Activities</h3><br/>
                <p>Extracurricular activities are an essential part of a well-rounded education. These activities enable students to apply academic skills in a real-world context. They also allow students to reinforce the lessons learned in the classroom.

If you have a high school student, you know that extracurricular activities are critical for college admissions. Many colleges and universities value extracurricular activities because they contribute to developing the "whole student."

However, extracurricular activities benefit all students, regardless of their plans for after high school. Employers want to hire well-rounded job candidates. In fact, extracurricular activities are great additions to that first resume.</p><br/>

                <h3>Student Club</h3>
                <p>school, there is a wide variety of clubs and activities available for students to join. Clubs and activities are a great way to find where you belong in your high school social community and to find your niche among students with similar interests and goals.

 

                    Extracurriculars allow you to pursue your current interests and passions and perhaps even find ones you didn’t know you had. Thus, when you’re looking for clubs to join, try to pursue a mix of activities that you are familiar with and ones that may be out of your comfort zone. You’ll have plenty of time throughout high school to narrow down which ones are best for you.

 

                   Regardless of which activities you join, it’s important to get involved in your high school community for the sake of your college applications. Colleges want to see that their students were well rounded and were able to handle multiple responsibilities at once throughout high school, and extracurricular involvement is a sure sign of both.

 

                  If you’re unsure of which clubs and activities you should join, here’s a comprehensive list of clubs and organizations for you to get involved in during high school.</p><br/>
